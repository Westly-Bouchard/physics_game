This is a game all about physics, specifically building circuits!
This was created for a physics final project cause we decided that it would be a good idea to write an entire game in the span of about 6 weeks while *also* 
learning many new technologies including:
- Rust
- Bevy (a game enigne written in rust)
- Web Assembly
- And how to make games in general

Let me tell you, it was a very interesting 6 weeks
